Before dismantling and museification, the cabinet with all items in situ was meticulously documented using a drone. This will allow for the artifacts to be recreated with maximum accuracy in museum exhibitions. Since then, the Headquarters has been systematically working on the museification of the contemporary Russian-Ukrainian war: collecting and preserving artifacts, witness testimonies, and archiving documentary photo and video materials. Also, the Headquarters' experts are involved in the memorialization of commemorative sites and the development of methodological recommendations. With an educational purpose, based on the collected artifacts and materials, the Headquarters organizes exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad, aiming to draw attention to the destruction of Ukrainian heritage by the aggressor."}
