      p: Expedition to rescue and museologicalize a kitchen cabinet and a ceramic rooster vessel - objects that have become a symbol of the resilience of Ukrainians and which have been preserved and entered into the Museum Fund of Ukraine.
    - p: A "special operation" was carried out to museify the legendary kitchen cabinet and save all its contents. From now on, it is already in the funds of the National Museum of the Revolution of Dignity. Together with the cabinet, a decorative ceramic rooster that survived the explosion of a racist aerial bomb was handed over to the museum.
    - p: About two weeks have passed since the liberation of Kyiv Oblast from the occupier. The topographical map of Ukraine has been replenished with places of new mass crimes by Russians. The time will come, and these tragic pages of our history will definitely be memorialized and understood, and the memory of the innocent victims of the war has already become part of the national memory, as well as evidence of the heroism and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the fight for freedom against a base and cynical enemy .
    - p: "One of the symbols of this resilience is a kitchen cabinet on the wall of a high-rise building completely destroyed by a bomb in Borodyanka, Kyiv region. The cabinet survived, although there seemed to be no chance of that. Miraculously, everything was preserved: porcelain dishes, glazed doors, containers for spices, traditional souvenirs and even a decorative zoomorphic vessel for drinks, made back in the 60s of the last century by the outstanding masters of artistic ceramics, Valery Vasylkova and Nadia Protorieva."
    - p: An ordinary element of the kitchen interior became a legend thanks to the photo of Kyiv photojournalist Elizaveta Servatynska. Now this photo has gone around the world.

      The photo of the rooster and the locker, which survived with all the utensils on the wall of the destroyed high-rise building, is a kind of illustration of perhaps the most common call-to-action among Ukrainians today: \"How are you?\" - \"Hold on...\"
    - p: However, the building on which the locker is kept is in a state of disrepair, the wall is about to collapse. So there was a need to save and preserve this unique symbol of Ukrainian resistance.
    - p: On April 14, 2022, with the permission of the owner of the apartment, Nadia Svatko, the locker was carefully dismantled. It was important to preserve every detail, right down to the screws used to attach the cabinet to the wall. The surrounding area, the ruins of buildings and the wall with the locker itself were documented by Dron.ua using a drone to create a 3D model, photos and videos were taken, every detail was recorded, which in the future will allow to reproduce the location of the object and the environment with maximum accuracy. Also, representatives of the Maidan Museum and the Dovzhenko Center took a lot of photos, collected a unique collection of things from the ruins, and recorded the oral testimonies of the residents of the neighboring buildings.
    - p: The difficult rescue operation was initiated and implemented by the Mizhvukhamy cultural institution in partnership with the Maidan Museum, the Heritage Rescue Headquarters and System Solutions PJSC. The museification became possible with the assistance of the Borodyansk Settlement United Territorial Community and the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy. And thanks to the high professionalism of the employees of the State Emergency Service, the Borodyan symbol of our indomitability and immortality and the victory of light over darkness is from now on the property of the museum fund of Ukraine.
    - p: This is the first expedition by which the Heritage Rescue Headquarters together with its partners begin systematic work on the collection of artifacts from the war between Russia and Ukraine. Our task is to record and preserve material and non-material evidence of courage and courage of Ukrainians, their ability to help each other and intransigence to enemies, heroic struggle for dignity and freedom.
    - p: Museum workers, cultural figures, soldiers and activists are currently actively working to preserve the memory of the war, try not to lose sight of important objects and symbols, follow the hot tracks of our tragedies and victories in order to preserve the memory of the most defining event in modern history. The day will come when those who, defending Ukraine, went through the hell of war, will take their children and grandchildren to the museum to honor our heroes and show young people not only the history of the struggle, but also what we fought for.
