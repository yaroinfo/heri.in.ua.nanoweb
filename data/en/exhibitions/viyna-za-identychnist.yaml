  content:
    - p: From the first days of the full-scale war, Ukraine has been suffering losses in its cultural heritage. The de-Ukrainization promoted by Russia as the goal of the war involves the destruction of everything that carries the national code.
    - p: At the exhibition's core are materials collected during the activities of the HERI. The objects are evidence of destruction, but also Ukrainian resistance. Some objects display clear international support. Many of the artifacts were during expeditions. In 2014, these were expeditions to the Maidan, and now to the territories that suffered from ruscists.
    - p: The exhibition includes about 200 artifacts from the Revolution of Dignity and the Russian-Ukrainian War. For the first time, a cabinet and a rooster from Borodianka, which were museified during the expedition in April 2022, were presented together.
