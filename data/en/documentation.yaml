            Rescue documentation expeditions of the Headquarters began with an expedition to the famous kitchen cabinet
            with a ceramic rooster in Borodyanka, which survived despite a bombing and the collapse of the building.
            Before dismantling and musealization, the cabinet and all its items were meticulously documented using a drone.
            This will allow for the most accurate recreation of the artifacts in a museum exhibition in the future.
            Since then, the Headquarters' expeditions have taken on a comprehensive character: assessing losses and risks
            to cultural heritage objects using the international methodology of ICCROM, accompanied by photo and video
            documentation, aerial photography using drones (to create 3D models via photogrammetry), rescuing objects - future
            artifacts for museums, recording eyewitness testimonies and local residents, and filling out forms.
        - p: Expeditions are preceded by thorough preparation regarding safety, prioritization of regions and objects,
            coordination with the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, military-civil administration, local
            authorities, and leadership of cultural institutions, and local communities.

          h2: Creating 3D Models of Destroyed Heritage
        - p: |
            An important result of documenting losses and damages during expeditions is the 3D model of the object.
            Detailed documentation (laser scanning or photogrammetry) not only captures all the main characteristics and
            the condition of the monument at the time of scanning, allows for professional analysis of the condition and
            planning of priority rescue operations, but also enables the recreation of the monument in augmented or virtual
            reality technology.
        - p: In April-June, with the help of photogrammetry and laser scanning, 3D models of damaged objects were created
            in the towns of Borodyanka and Irpin in the Kyiv region, the village of Vyazivka in the Zhytomyr region, the
            city of Kharkiv, and the Chernihiv region..
